    """
    Test the functionality of the ReconcilerForecaster class.

    This test checks if the ReconcilerForecaster can be successfully fitted and used to make predictions.
    It uses a NaiveForecaster as the base forecaster and a LinearRegression model as the regressor.
    The test ensures that the reconciler can make predictions for a given forecasting horizon and that 
    the number of predictions matches the length of the forecasting horizon.

    Steps:
    1. Generate random target data for forecasting.
    2. Set up the base forecaster (NaiveForecaster) and regressor (LinearRegression).
    3. Split data using KFold cross-validation.
    4. Create an instance of the ReconcilerForecaster with the base forecaster, regressor, and cross-validation strategy.
    5. Define a forecasting horizon.
    6. Fit the reconciler forecaster using the generated data.
    7. Predict future values using the reconciler forecaster.
    8. Assert that the number of predictions matches the length of the forecasting horizon.
